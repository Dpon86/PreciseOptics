# Frontend API Field Mapping Fix - Summary

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Problem:**
The frontend React form was sending data with incorrect field names and missing required fields, causing 400 Bad Request errors when trying to create patients via the Django REST API.

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
- ✅ Backend API was working perfectly (confirmed with manual testing)
- ❌ Frontend was using wrong field names and missing required fields
- ❌ Form validation on frontend was insufficient

## 🔧 **Specific Fixes Applied:**

  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
  "gender": "M",
