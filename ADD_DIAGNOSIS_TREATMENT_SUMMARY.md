## API Integration

### Added to `frontend/src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
// Diagnoses
getDiagnoses: (params = {}) => axios.get('/api/diagnoses/', { params }),
createDiagnosis: (data) => axios.post('/api/diagnoses/', data),
updateDiagnosis: (id, data) => axios.put(`/api/diagnoses/${id}/`, data),
getDiagnosis: (id) => axios.get(`/api/diagnoses/${id}/`),

// Treatments
getTreatments: (params = {}) => axios.get('/api/treatments/', { params }),
createTreatment: (data) => axios.post('/api/treatments/', data),
updateTreatment: (id, data) => axios.put(`/api/treatments/${id}/`, data),
getTreatment: (id) => axios.get(`/api/treatments/${id}/`),
```

## Routing Configuration

### Added to `frontend/src/App.js`:
```javascript
// Route definitions
/patients/:patientId/add-diagnosis  -> AddDiagnosisPage
/patients/:patientId/add-treatment  -> AddTreatmentPage
```

### Updated Exports in `frontend/src/pages/patients/index.js`:
- Added AddDiagnosisPage export
- Added AddTreatmentPage export

## Navigation Integration
The pages are accessible via:
1. **Patient Dashboard**: "Add Diagnosis" and "Add Treatment" buttons
2. **Direct URL**: `/patients/{patientId}/add-diagnosis` or `/patients/{patientId}/add-treatment`
3. **Navigation**: Integrated with existing sidebar and breadcrumb navigation

## Backend Requirements
**Note**: These frontend pages assume the following Django backend endpoints exist:
- `POST /api/diagnoses/` - Create new diagnosis
- `POST /api/treatments/` - Create new treatment
- `GET /api/diagnoses/` - List diagnoses (for validation/reference)
- `GET /api/treatments/` - List treatments (for validation/reference)

## Medical Compliance Features

### Data Integrity
- Comprehensive form validation
- Required field enforcement
- Medical terminology standardization
- ICD-10 code integration
- Audit trail compatibility

### Safety Protocols
- Contraindication warnings
- Emergency contact protocols
- Allergy and medication interaction alerts
- Professional liability considerations
- HIPAA compliance considerations

### Professional Workflow
- Multi-step form progression
- Save draft functionality
- Review and confirmation steps
- Integration with existing patient records
- Comprehensive documentation requirements

## Testing Recommendations

### Form Validation Testing
1. Test all required field validations
2. Verify ICD-10 code validation
3. Test date and time field constraints
4. Verify textarea character limits
5. Test form submission success/error handling

### Integration Testing
1. Test patient context retrieval
2. Verify API endpoint connectivity
3. Test navigation from patient dashboard
4. Verify success redirection flows
5. Test error handling and user feedback

### Accessibility Testing
1. Screen reader compatibility
2. Keyboard navigation functionality
3. Color contrast compliance
4. Focus indicator visibility
5. Form label associations

## Next Steps
1. **Backend Integration**: Ensure Django backend has corresponding API endpoints
2. **Database Models**: Verify diagnosis and treatment models exist in Django
3. **User Testing**: Conduct healthcare professional usability testing
4. **Documentation**: Update user manuals with new functionality
5. **Training**: Prepare staff training materials for new features

## Production Readiness Notes
