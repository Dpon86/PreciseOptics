- [ ] **HIGH**: Application Performance Monitoring (APM) not configured
- [ ] **HIGH**: Database performance monitoring missing
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: User activity monitoring needs enhancement
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Structured logging with correlation IDs not implemented

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: CI/CD pipeline not configured
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Container orchestration not set up

### Compliance & Audit
- [ ] **HIGH**: HIPAA compliance assessment not completed
- [ ] **HIGH**: Data encryption at rest not implemented
- [ ] **HIGH**: Audit trail reporting automation missing
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: GDPR compliance features need review
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Medical record retention policies not automated

### Backup & Disaster Recovery
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Automated backup system not implemented
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Disaster recovery plan not documented
- [ ] **HIGH**: Point-in-time recovery capability missing
- [ ] **HIGH**: Backup encryption not configured
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Multi-region deployment for redundancy not set up

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **HIGH**: End-to-end testing suite incomplete
- [ ] **HIGH**: Load testing not performed
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Security testing (OWASP) not automated
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Accessibility testing not comprehensive
- [ ] **LOW**: Cross-browser compatibility testing could be expanded

## Completed Production Items
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Basic Django authentication system implemented
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Django REST Framework API structure established
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Basic audit logging framework established
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Patient data models with proper relationships
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Eye test data models implemented
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Medication tracking system implemented
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Basic React frontend structure
- [x] **COMPLETED**: API integration between frontend and backend

## Notes and Migration Priority

### Critical Path Items (Release Blockers)
1. Database migration from SQLite to production database
2. Security configuration (HTTPS, authentication, rate limiting)
3. Debug mode and secret key configuration
4. Automated backup system
5. Health monitoring and error tracking

### High Priority Items (Must Have for Launch)
- Performance optimization (caching, query optimization)
- Monitoring and observability
- Role-based access control refinement
- Compliance assessment and data encryption

### Medium/Low Priority Items (Post-Launch Improvements)
- Advanced deployment strategies
- Infrastructure automation
- Enhanced testing coverage
- Performance optimizations
